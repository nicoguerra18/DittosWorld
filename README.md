Ditto's World is an isometric desktop game created using ReactJS for the front-end, CSS for styling, and the Pok√©mon API for game data. The primary goal of this project was to enhance my skills in React and web application development. Although React is not typically known as a game development framework, using it for this purpose provided a unique, fun, and rewarding learning experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the process of building this application and look forward to continue adding to the game. I hope you find it just as fun to explore!
